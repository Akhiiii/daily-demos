# (DEPRECATED) Daily CSS grid layout demo 

This demo illustrated how to build a fully customized video call using Daily and CSS grid layout. 

We will be deprecating support for this demo at the end of 2020 because building in call object mode, like we do in the [React demo](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-demos/tree/master/react-demo), better meets the needs of developers who want to build an entirely custom call interface.
